    <h1>Honey Glazed Ham</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>"Better than the famous honey baked ham at the store," user Kim Kebabjian DeWall says of this top-rated recipe. "I have some good tips! I used an ordinary Kirkland spiral ham from Costco ... about 8 pounds. I think buying a spiral ham is key because all the glaze can get into the slices."
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham</li>
        <li>¼ cup whole cloves</li>
        <li>¼ cup dark corn syrup</li>
        <li>2 cups honey</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan.</li>
        <li>In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.</li>
        <li>Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving.
